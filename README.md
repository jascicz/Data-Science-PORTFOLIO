# Data Science Portfolio.

Welcome!!! to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio, where I share projects and analysis that I have done using Python and a variety of libraries in this area. Below you'll find a list of projects, along with brief descriptions and links to each.

## Featured Projects

### * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Models:

**Linear Regression Models**

- **Ecommerce Customers**: A New York-based fashion company, dedicated to selling clothing online and in physical stores, wants to know if it should focus its resources on optimizing the user experience on its mobile app or website to boost its earnings. Join me in exploring and investigating whether there were other influential factors in this decision-making process.
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-learn
  - [Ver Proyecto](/Linear-Regression-Models/Ecommerce_service.ipynb)
  - [Ver Data_set](/Linear-Regression-Models/Ecommerce%20Customers.csv)
