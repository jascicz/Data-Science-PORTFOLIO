# Data Science Portfolio.

Welcome!!! to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio, where I share projects and analysis that I have done using Python and a variety of libraries in this area. Below you'll find a list of projects using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models, along with brief descriptions and links to each.

## Featured Projects.


**LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS**

- **Ecommerce Customers**: A New York-based fashion company, dedicated to selling clothing online and in physical stores, wants to know if it should focus its resources on optimizing the user experience on its mobile app or website to boost its earnings. Join me in exploring and investigating whether there were other influential factors in this decision-making process.
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-learn
  - [Ver Proyecto](/Linear-Regression-Models/Ecommerce_service.ipynb)
  - [Ver Data_set](/Linear-Regression-Models/Ecommerce%20Customers.csv)

 
**LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS**

- **Advertisement**: In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
  
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-learn
  - [Ver Proyecto](/Logistic-Regression-Models/Advertisement%20LRP.ipynb)
  - [Ver Data_set](/Logistic-Regression-Models/advertising.csv)



**DECISION TREES AND RANDOM FOREST MODELS**

- **Lending Club**: For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model (both models were implemented) that will help predict this. 
  
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Graphviz
  - [Ver Proyecto](/DecisionTrees-and-RandomForest-Models/Lending_Club.ipynb)
  - [Ver Data_set](/DecisionTrees-and-RandomForest-Models/loan_data.csv)


**SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES AND GRIDSEARCHCV**

- **Iris flower**: In this project we will create a model to predict the type of flower, based on the dimensions of the petals and sepals. The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
